## Description

  a linked list algorithm to utilize the spaced repetition method of memorization.
  Users are presented with a word in Esperanto and asked to enter the equivalent
  word in English. Based on a getting the word correct or incorrect, the user will
  see that word less or more often in the future, respectively.

  A user's progress is also stored when they log out. Upon their return, the user
  be presented with the last word they were given in their previous session.
